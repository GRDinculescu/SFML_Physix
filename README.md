# SFML_Physix

## Project motivation
- As a new and ordered challenge for myself
- A simple physics engine in C++ using SFML for visualization

## Current goals
### 1. Collisions
- Collision between objects of the same type
- Collision between objects of different type

### 2. Program
- Menu and settings
- Different scenes, such as an orbital simulation

### 3. Optimization
- Optimize collisions
- Implement component based entities (Unity style)
